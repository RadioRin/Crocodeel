;beer_style;description
1;Hefeweizen;"A south German style of wheat beer (weissbier) made with a typical ratio of 50:50, or even higher, wheat. A yeast that produces a unique phenolic flavors of banana and cloves with an often dry and tart edge, some spiciness, bubblegum or notes of apples. Little hop bitterness, and a moderate level of alcohol. The ""Hefe"" prefix means ""with yeast"", hence the beers unfiltered and cloudy appearance. Poured into a traditional Weizen glass, the Hefeweizen can be one sexy looking beer."
2;English Strong Ale;"Malty, with complex fruity esters. Some oxidative notes are acceptable, akin to those found in port or sherry. Hop aromas not usually present, due to extended age. Medium amber to very dark red-amber color. Malty and usually sweet. Alcoholic strength should be evident, though not overwhelming. Medium to full body; alcohol should contribute some warmth. An ale of significant alcoholic strength, though usually not as strong or rich as barleywine. Usually tilted toward a sweeter, more malty balance. Often regarded as winter warmers, and often released as seasonal beers."
3;Foreign / Export Stout;A special style of stout that is brewed bigger than normal for a long journey, the more traditional Foreign / Export Stouts will be found in the tropical regions of the world. Higher in alcohol with a very pronounced roasted character. 
4;German Pilsener;Classic German Pilsners are very light straw to golden in color. Head should be dense and rich. They are also well-hopped, brewed using Noble hops such has Saaz, Hallertauer, Hallertauer Mittelfr?h, Tettnanger, Styrian Goldings, Spalt, Perle, and Hersbrucker. These varieties exhibit a spicy herbal or floral aroma and flavor, often times a bit coarse on the palate, and distribute a flash of citrus-like zest--hop bitterness can be high.
5;American Double / Imperial IPA;"Take an India Pale Ale and feed it steroids, ergo the term Double IPA. Although open to the same interpretation as its sister styles, you should expect something robust, malty, alcoholic and with a hop profile that might rip your tongue out. The Imperial usage comes from Russian Imperial stout, a style of strong stout originally brewed in England for the Russian Imperial Court of the late 1700s; though Double IPA is often the preferred name."
6;Herbed / Spiced Beer;"This style takes on and beer that is specially herbed and or spiced. This is anything from the common spiced Fall Pumpkin beer to Christmas beers with nutmeg and cinnamon to ginger beers to heather ales. Some brewers will throw just about anything into the brew kettle; hot peppers, hemp, ginseng or spruce needles. Keep you mind open when you are trying some as brewers will always keep on trying to expand the limits of what beer is."
7;Light Lager;On tap at the brewpub, pale yellow color, with an of-white heaf, light toasted, pale malt, honeyed nose with a subtle floral hop grassy accent in the aroma follows through on a light-bodied palate with a crisp citrusy, light pale malt character with a faint flowery hop lemony, grassy undertones, leading towards a very light lingering hop bitterness finish. So tasteless!!!!
8;Oatmeal Stout;Oatmeal Stouts are a Stout style with oats added to the brewing process. Normally, there is a maximum of 30% oats added to the grains. The color should be the same as other Stout styles, usually very dark brown or even black. The aroma should have a rich roasted malt character, with notes of caramel and chocolate. There should also be notable coffee or roasted barley smells, usually apparent as chocolate or nut smells. The taste should be smooth and full, with coffee-like bitterness apparent but not overwhelming. Roasted notes of malts and barley should be apparent also. Hop aroma and taste should be very low. Feel should be medium to full bodied. ABV ranges from 3.8% to 6% and sometimes higher. IBUs range from 20 to 40.
9;American Pale Lager;"Sometimes referred to as ""all-malt,"" this category of beer refers to lagers brewed without cereal adjuncts (mainly rice or corn). Though often still yellow and fizzy, these beers will display a broader depth of malt flavor and a more complex bitterness vs. their adjunct counterparts."
10;Rauchbier;Rauchbier is a German smoked beer. The color should be dark copper to dark brown. The aroma should have a combination of smoke and malts. The smoked aroma should be very notable also. The taste follows the aroma. There should be a blend of smoke and malts, with the smoke flavors obvious. Smoked cheeses are similar in character. There should also be a slight malt sweetness apparent. Hop bitterness should be minimally apparent in both aroma and taste. The feel should be medium bodied. ABV ranged from 4.8% to 6%. IBUs range from 20 to 30.
11;American Pale Ale (APA);Of British origin, this style is now popular worldwide and the use of local ingredients, or imported, produces variances in character from region to region. Generally, expect a good balance of malt and hops. Fruity esters and diacetyl can vary from none to moderate, and bitterness can range from lightly floral to pungent.
12;American Porter;American Porters are distinguished from English Porters by having a more notable flavor and aroma. In particular, the hop presence should be much more notable in both aroma and flavor. The ABV range should be from 5% to 7%. The IBUs should range from 25-50.
13;Belgian Strong Dark Ale;On the same path as the Belgian Dark Ale but obviously higher in alcohol with more of an all around character. The alcohol character can be deceivingly hidden or can be very bold and in your face. Look for lots of complexity within a delicate palate. Hop and malt character can vary, most are fruity and may have mild dark malt flavors. Phenols will range from minimal to high and most will be light on the hops. All in all most are spicy and alcoholic.
14;American IPA;The American India Pale Ale (IPA) style has an extremely notable hop presence in both aroma and taste. The hop character is always front and center and notable as a floral or citrus character that is quite strong. The color should be light gold to copper and the the feel should be medium with moderate carbonation. The malt character of the style is generally subordinated to the hops. ABV is usually in the range of 5% to 8% and IBUs range from 50 to 70 or higher.
15;American Stout;The American Stout is highlighted by a dark brown to black color. Head retention should be notable also. Aroma has pronounced tones of caramel, chocolate, coffee and a very notable roasted smell. Taste has notable coffee and roasted bitterness, with low to medium hop tones. Any hop tones are usually highlighted by subdued citrus notes. Feel should be medium to full bodied. ABV can range from 5% to 9% and higher. IBUs should range from 30 to 60.
16;Russian Imperial Stout;Inspired by brewers back in the 1800's to win over the Russian Czar, this is the king of stouts, boasting high alcohol by volumes and plenty of malt character. Low to moderate levels of carbonation with huge roasted, chocolate and burnt malt flavours. Often dry. Suggestions of dark fruit and flavors of higher alcohols are quite evident. Hop character can vary from none, to balanced to aggressive.
17;American Amber / Red Ale;Primarily a catch all for any beer less than a Dark Ale in color, ranging from amber (duh) to deep red hues. This style of beer tends to focus on the malts, but hop character can range from low to high. Expect a balanced beer, with toasted malt characters and a light fruitiness in most examples. The range can run from a basic ale, to American brewers who brew faux-Oktoberfest style beers that are actually ales instead of lagers.
18;American Strong Ale;"""The term American Strong Ale is usually used as a """"catch-all"""" category for any dark and strong beers that defy a traditional beer style description. This """"style"""" shares characteristics with several beers style, including barleywines, old ales and even Double IPAs. Most examples of the style are dark in color, from dark amber to almost black. Hop presence in aroma and flavor can vary widely within the style. One notable factor of most examples of the style is a relatively high ABV, usually 7% or higher."""
19;Marzen / Oktoberfest;This yeast produces a very malty, bock-like beer. It does not finish as dry as WLP830. It’s much slower in the first generation than WLP830, so we encourage using a larger starter during the first generation or scheduling a longer lagering time.
20;American Adjunct Lager;Light bodied, pale, fizzy lagers made popular by the large macro-breweries (large breweries) of America after prohibition. Low bitterness, thin malts, and moderate alcohol. Focus is less on flavor and more on mass-production and consumption, cutting flavor and sometimes costs with adjunct cereal grains, like rice and corn.
21;American Blonde Ale;More or less a creation from the craft-brewery movement, and also reminiscent of the German style K?lsch. Pale straw to deep gold for color. Usually an all malt brew, well attenuated with a lightly malty palate. Most have a subdued fruitiness. Hop character is of the noble variety, or similar, leaving a light to medium bitterness. A balanced beer, light bodied and sometimes lager like.
22;Euro Pale Lager;Similar to the Munich Helles story, many European countries reacted to the popularity of early pale lagers by brewing their own. Hop flavor is significant and of noble varieties, bitterness is moderate, and both are backed by a solid malt body and sweetish notes from an all-malt base
23;English Brown Ale;Spawned from the Mild Ale, Brown Ales tend to be maltier and sweeter on the palate, with a fuller body. Color can range from reddish brown to dark brown. Some versions will lean towards fruity esters, while others tend to be drier with nutty characters. All seem to have a low hop aroma and bitterness.
24;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;"Scotch Ales traditionally go through a long boil in the kettle for a caramelization of the wort. This produces a deep copper to brown in colored brew. Compared to Scottish Ales, they'll be sweeter and fuller-bodied, and of course higher in alcohol, with a much more pronounced malty caramel and roasted malt flavor. A low tea-like bitterness can be found in many examples. Best served in a ""thistle"" glass."
25;Fruit / Vegetable Beer;A generic form of flavored beer, some breweries actually use real fruit or veggies, though most use an extract, syrup or processed flavor to give the effect of a particular fruit or vegetable. Usually ales, but with not much ale character to them and commonly unbalanced. Malt flavor is typically hidden with a low hop bitterness to allow the fruit or vegetable to dominate.
26;American Double / Imperial Stout;The American Double Stout gets some of it inspiration from the Russian Imperial Stout. Many of these are barrel aged, mostly in bourbon / whiskey barrels, while some are infused with coffee or chocolate. Alcohol ranges vary, but tend to be quite big, and bigger than traditional Russian Imperial Stouts. Most tend to have cleaner alcohol flavors, higher hop levels, and more residual sweetness. Very full-bodied with rich roasted flavors far surpassing normal stouts.
27;Belgian Pale Ale;Belgian Pale Ales are light to medium ales that have a mild aroma and low hops bitterness. The color is usually light golden to amber in color, occasionally even a darker amber. The aroma has minimal hops notes, with a mild malt and fruity sweetness. There may even be a mild spicy tone in the aroma. The taste also has minimal hops bitterness. The mild malt sweetness is also notable in the flavor, along with a minor caramel or toasted grain taste. Feel should be on the low to medium side. ABV ranges from 4% to 6%. IBUs are generally low and range from 20 to 30.
28;English Bitter;The Bitter style came from brewers who wanted to differentiate these ales from other mild brews, enter pale malts and more hops. Most are gold to copper in colour and are light bodied. Low carbonation. Alcohol should be low and not perceived. Hop bitterness is moderate to assertive. Most have a fruitiness in the aroma and flavor, diacetyl can also be present. These are traditionally served cask conditioned, but many breweries have bottled versions.
29;English Porter;The English Porter has a history dating back to 1721, when it was first mentioned. The color of the English Porter should range from light brown to dark brown, almost black. The aroma should have a strong malt presence, with notes of chocolate, coffee, and roasted grains. The taste should focus on the malts, with roasted malts, toffee, caramel and nutty tones present. Other flavors may include coffee, bready yeast and toasted rye bread. Hop presence in both aroma and flavor should be minimal. The feel should be medium bodied. ABV ranges from 4% to 5.4%. IBUs should range from 18 to 35.
30;Irish Dry Stout;One of the most common stouts, Dry Irish Stout tend to have light-ish bodies to keep them on the highly drinkable side. They're usually a lower carbonation brew and served on a nitro system for that creamy, masking effect. Bitterness comes from both roasted barley and a generous dose of hops, though the roasted character will be more noticeable. Examples of the style are, of course, the big three, Murphy's, Beamish, and Guinness, however there are many American brewed Dry Stouts that are comparable, if not better.
31;American Barleywine;American Barleywines are a complex style that range from amber to dark copper in color. The mouthfeel is generally full and there is a notable malt sweetness, usually present as a caramel or toffee taste and smell. There is also a notable alcohol presence. Hop bitterness in the aroma and taste is medium to very high. ABV can range widely from 8% to 12% or higher.
32;Belgian Strong Pale Ale;Like a Belgian Pale Ale, the strong versions will also be pale to golden in color. What sets them apart is a much higher alcohol content that can range from hidden to spicy to devastatingly present. Expect a complex and powerful ale, yet delicate with rounded flavors and big, billowy, rocky, white head. Hop and malt character can vary, most are fruity and quite hoppy, but hop flavor and aroma will generally be within the low range and artfully balanced.
33;Doppelbock;"""Doppelbock (translates to """"double bock"""" in German) is a Bavarian beer style that was yet another German style to find its origins by being brewed by monks in centuries past. Along with bocks in general, it was considered """"liquid bread"""" by the monks in times of fasting. The color should range from dark copper to dark brown, but can sometimes be somewhat pale. The aroma should have have a very strong malt sweetness present, with toasted grains notable. Alcohol aroma may also be present. Finally, there may also be hints of chocolate and dark fruits. The taste should also center on the malts, with toasted bread notes and a somewhat notable alcohol taste. There should also be a semi-sweet or outright sweet malt taste, and very little or no hop flavors. The feel should be full bodied. ABV ranges from 6% to 10%. IBUs should be fairly low between 17 to 27."""
34;Maibock / Helles Bock;The Maibock style of beer tends to be lighter in color than other Bock beers and often has a significant hop character with a noticeable alcohol around the same as a traditional Bock. Maibocks are customarily served in the spring and are oftentimes interrelated with spring festivals and celebrations more often in the month of May.
35;Pumpkin Ale;Often released as a fall seasonal, Pumpkin Ales are quite varied. Some brewers opt to add hand-cut pumpkins and drop them in the mash, while others use puree or pumpkin flavoring. These beers also tend to be spiced with pumpkin pie spices, like: ground ginger, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and allspice. Pumpkin Ales are typically mild, with little to no bitterness, a malty backbone, with some spice often taking the lead. Many will contain a starchy, slightly thick-ish, mouthfeel too. In our opinion, best versions use real pumpkin, while roasting the pumpkin can also add tremendous depth of character for even better results, though both methods are time-consuming and tend to drive brewmasters insane.
36;Dortmunder / Export Lager;Made popular in the 19th century in Dortmund, Germany, these pale golden lagers exhibit a classic clean character with notes of biscuity malts. Bitterness is akin to a German Pilsner with an aromatic aroma. Mouthfeel is firm and even, with an overall dry tone.
37;Euro Strong Lager;Many breweries around the world brew a stronger version of their regular lager. For the US there is the Ice Beer & Malt Liquor, both have a high amount of rice or corn to lighten the flavor. Many European & Asian breweries have a strong lager similar to the Malt Liquor though there is more malt use or it is all malt. Many breweries rush the fermentation or the brew will be too light and signs of higher alcohols will be noticed in the aroma and flavor.
38;Euro Dark Lager;Dark lagers are enjoyed all year long, and they're not as filling as ales. Waterloo Dark will cut some of the heaviness in sauce-based meat dishes. Waterloo Dark is an equally perfect beer to go with appetizers suitable for watching sports games, or used as an actual ingredient when preparing a meal.
39;Low Alcohol Beer;Low Alcohol Beer is also commonly known as Non Alcohol (NA) beer, which is a fallacy as all of these beers still contain small amounts of alcohol. Low Alcohol Beers are generally subjected to one of two things: a controlled brewing process that results in a low alcohol content, or the alcohol is removed using a reverse-osmosis method which passes alcohol through a permeable membrane.
40;Weizenbock;Weizenbock is a strong German wheat beer. It is similar to a Hefeweizen, although darker and higher in malt flavor and alcohol. To be considered in this style, German law requires at least 50% wheat malt to be used in the brewing process. This style uses ale yeast, and gets a slightly spicy tone from the yeast. Color should be medium red-brown or darker, with a cloudy appearance. Aroma and taste should be highlighted by both wheat sweetness and malt characteristics such as caramel. ABV is likewise higher than pale German wheat style, usually 6% or higher.
41;Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB);"ESBs are essentially more aggressive and more balanced Bitters, both in alcohol and hop character, but nothing overpowering. Color range will be similar, though leaning towards the darker end of the scale; dark golds to copper. Low carbonation. Malts tend to be more pronounced, often toasty and fruity, with maybe some notes diacetyl. And despite ""bitter"" being in its name, ESBs are not really all that bitter. They key to an ESB is balance."
42;Bock;"The origins of Bock beer are quite uncharted. Back in medieval days German monasteries would brew a strong beer for sustenance during their Lenten fasts. Some believe the name Bock came from the shortening of Einbeck thus ""beck"" to ""bock."" Others believe it is more of a pagan or old world influence that the beer was only to be brewed during the sign of the Capricorn goat, hence the goat being associated with Bock beers. Basically, this beer was a symbol of better times to come and moving away from winter."
43;English India Pale Ale (IPA);First brewed in England and exported for the British troops in India during the late 1700s. To withstand the voyage, IPA's were basically tweaked Pale Ales that were, in comparison, much more malty, boasted a higher alcohol content and were well-hopped, as hops are a natural preservative. Historians believe that an IPA was then watered down for the troops, while officers and the elite would savor the beer at full strength. The English IPA has a lower alcohol due to taxation over the decades. The leaner the brew the less amount of malt there is and less need for a strong hop presence which would easily put the brew out of balance. Some brewers have tried to recreate the origianl IPA with strengths close to 8-9% abv.
44;Altbier;"""""""Alt"""" translates to """"old"""" in German. So """"Altbier"""" literally translated would be """"old beer"""". Despite the connotations of a beer that is past its prime, the name actually derives from the continuing deference to Rhineland brewing traditions. Altbier is a top-fermented ale that is copper in color. It is unique because it undergoes a period of cold-conditioning or lagering. Due to that fact, this style is a hybrid of both ales and lagers. Despite the usually notable hop bitterness, the lagering gives a well-rounded beer with a clean flavor dominated by the malts. Most Altbiers are around 4% to 5% ABV. The normal IBU range is 25 to 52, with most at the lower end of that range."""
45;Kolsch;It is a clear, top-fermented beer with a bright, straw-yellow hue similar to other beers brewed from mainly Pilsener malt. Kolsch is warm fermented at around 13 to 21 °C (55 to 70 °F), then conditioned by lagering at cold temperatures.[1] This style of fermentation links K?lsch with some other central northern European beers such as the Altbiers of western Germany and the Netherlands. Kolsch is defined by an agreement between members of the Cologne Brewery Association known as the Kolsch Konvention (de). It has a gravity between 11 and 16 degrees Plato.
46;Munich Dunkel Lager;An old friend of Bavaria, Munich Dunkels are smooth, rich and complex, but without being heady or heavy. They boast brilliant ruby hues from the large amounts of Munich malts used, and these malts also lend a fuller-bodied beer. The decoction brewing process also lends much depth and richness. Bitterness is often moderate, with just enough to balance out any sweetness. Hop varieties used tend to be of the German noble varieties, like: Tetnang and Hallertau.
47;Rye Beer;Not to be confused with a German Roggenbier, beers that fall into this category contain a notable amount of rye grain in the grist bill. Bitterness tends to be moderate, to allow the often spicy and sour-like rye characteristics to pull through.
48;American Pale Wheat Ale;An Americanized version of a Hefe Weizen, these beers range within the pale to golden range in color. Reminiscent of a Hefe Weizen in appearance, unless filtered. Long-lasting head with a light to medium body, higher carbonation is proper. German Weizen flavors and aromas of banana esters and clove-like phenols will not be found. Most use a substantial percentage of wheat malt. Hop character will be low to high but most are moderate in bitterness. There may be some fruitiness from ale fermentation though most examples use of a fairly neutral ale yeast, resulting in a clean fermentation with little to no diacetyl.
49;Milk / Sweet Stout;Milk / Sweet Stouts are basically stouts that have a larger amount of residual dextrins and unfermented sugars that give the brew more body and a sweetness that counters the roasted character. Milk Stouts are very similar to Sweet Stouts, but brewers add unfermentable sugars, usually lactose, to the brew kettle to add body and some sweetness.
50;Schwarzbier;"""Schwarzbier is a German style of """"black beer"""" that uses lager yeast. The aroma and taste usually include subtle hints chocolate or coffee. The feel should be somewhat thin. ABV should be in the lower range around 3% to 6%"""
51;Vienna Lager;Vienna Lager is a lager style that was originated in Vienna, Austria. The color should be medium red-brown to copper. There should be an obvious malt sweetness in both aroma and taste. Hop presence should be low. Mouthfeel should be clean and crisp. ABV should also be somewhat low.
52;American Amber / Red Lager;A sort of catch-all category, these lagers boast a bit more malt backbone and overall character than their lighter sister styles. Bitterness is generally low
53;Scottish Ale;Scottish Ales traditionally go through a long boil in the kettle for a caramelization of the wort. This produces a deep copper to brown in colored brew and a higher level of unfermentable sugars which create a rich mouthfeel and malty flavors and aromas. Overall hop character is low, light floral or herbal, allowing its signature malt profile to be the highlight. Smoky characters are also common.
54;Witbier;"""Witbier (literally, """"white beer"""" in Belgium) is one Belgian version of a wheat beer. It is also sometimes called a """"Witte"""". The color should be straw yellow to gold, with a notable cloudy haze. A true historical rendering of the style will not use hops, but instead a mixture of spices, herbs and orange. However, current versions of the style generally include hops as a portion of the mixture (or """"gruit""""). Despite that fact, the hop presence in both aroma and flavor should be minimal. However, there should be a notable citrus or slight acidity present. ABV should be somewhat low."""
55;American Black Ale;"Also referred to as a Black IPA (India Pale Ale) or Cascadian Dark Ale, ales of this style range from dark brown to pitch black and showcase malty and light to moderate roasty notes and are often quite hoppy generally with the use of American hops. Alcohol can range from average to high depending on if the brewery is going for a ""dobule / imperial"" version."
56;Saison / Farmhouse Ale;"Saisons are sturdy farmhouse ale that was traditionally brewed in the winter, to be consumed throughout the summer months. Not so long ago it was close to being an endangered style, but over recent years there's been a massive revival; especially in the US. This is a very complex style; many are very fruity in the aroma and flavor. Look for earthy yeast tones, mild to moderate tartness. Lots of spice and with a medium bitterness. They tend to be semi-dry with many only having touch of sweetness."
57;English Barleywine;The English Barleywine is generally a less bitter version of the American Barleywine. Hop notes are subdued because English hop varieties are usually (but not always) used in the style. Like the American Barleywine, this basic barleywine style is intended to be appreciated for the complexity of the flavors. The high alcohol content generally means that it can be aged for long periods, sometimes many years.The color should range from medium copper to Dark brown to black in some examples. The aroma should be very strong and dominated by the high malty sweetness. There should also be notes of fruits, toasted grains and caramel. Alcohol notes should be strong. Hop notes should be very subdued or nonexistent. The taste should also be dominated by the malts and alcohol, similar to the aroma. The feel should be very full bodied. ABV generally ranges from 8% to 12% and sometimes considerably higher. IBUs should range from 40 to 60.
58;English Dark Mild Ale;The quintessential British session beer, like its name suggests, a Mild is known for its low level of hops character. Alcohol content is traditionally very low. Grainy to toasty malts might be present, but expect some body from the high dextrins produced in brewing. Low carbonation with a near still, bubbly head. Colors can range from gold to dark brown. Traditionally a draft beer made popular in London and the Midlands of England.
59;California Common / Steam Beer;The California Common, or Steam Beer, is a unique 100% American style lager. It's usually brewed with a special strain of lager yeast that works better at warmer temperatures. This method dates back to the late 1800's in California when refrigeration was a great luxury. The brewers back then had to improvise to cool the beer down, so shallow fermenters were used. So in a way the lager yeast was trained to ferment quicker at warmer temperatures. Today's examples are light amber to tawny in color, medium bodied with a malty character. Mildly fruity with an assertive hop bitterness.
60;Czech Pilsener;The birth of Pilsner beer can be traced back to its namesake, the ancient city of Plzen (or Pilsen) which is situated in the western half of the Czech Republic in what was once Czechoslovakia and previously part of the of Bohemian Kingdom. Pilsner beer was first brewed back in the 1840's when the citizens, brewers and maltsters of Plzen formed a brewer's guild and called it the People's Brewery of Pilsen. The Czech Pilsner, or sometimes known as the Bohemian Pilsner, is light straw to golden color and crystal clear. Hops are very prevalent usually with a spicy bitterness and or a spicy floral flavor and aroma, notably one of the defining characteristics of the Saaz hop. Smooth and crisp with a clean malty palate, many are grassy. Some of the originals will show some archaic yeast characteristics similar to very mild buttery or fusel (rose like alcohol) flavors and aromas.
61;English Pale Ale;The English Pale Ale can be traced back to the city of Burton-upon-Trent, a city with an abundance of rich hard water. This hard water helps with the clarity as well as enhancing the hop bitterness. This ale can be from golden to reddish amber in color with generally a good head retention. A mix of fruity, hoppy, earthy, buttery and malty aromas and flavors can be found. Typically all ingredients are English.
62;Belgian IPA;"""The Belgian IPA combines the hoppy character of the American IPA style with the spicy notes or fruity esters of many Belgian styles. The base style that is usually used is a Tripel. Therefore, the color tends to be lighter colored and higher in alcohol. Since this is essentially a """"Euro IPA"""", brewers tend to use European hop varieties in the brewing process. This gives it a somewhat more subdued hop profile when compared to American IPAs."""
63;Tripel;"The name ""Tripel"" actually stems from part of the brewing process, in which brewers use up to three times the amount of malt than a standard Trappist ""Simple."" Traditionally, Tripels are bright yellow to gold in color, which is a shade or two darker than the average Pilsener. Head should be big, dense and creamy. Aroma and flavor runs along complex, spicy phenolic, powdery yeast, fruity/estery with a sweet finish. Sweetness comes from both the pale malts and the higher alcohol. Bitterness is up there for a beer with such a light body for its strength, but at times is barely perceived amongst the even balance of malts and hops. The lighter body comes from the use of Belgian candy sugar (up to 25% sucrose), which not only lightens the body, but also adds complex alcoholic aromas and flavors. Small amounts of spices are sometimes added as well. Tripels are actually notoriously alcoholic, yet the best crafted ones hide this character quite evil-like and deceivingly, making them sipping beers.
"
64;Flanders Oud Bruin;Oud Bruins, not restricted to, but concentrated in Flanders, are light to medium-bodied, deep copper to brown in colour. They are extremely varied, characterized by a slight vinegar or lactic sourness and spiciness to smooth and sweet. A fruity-estery character is apparent with no hop flavor or aroma. Low to medium bitterness. Very small quantities of diacetyl are acceptable. Roasted malt character in aroma and flavor is acceptable, at low levels. Oak-like or woody characters may be pleasantly integrated into overall palate. Typically old and new Brown ales are blended, like Lambics.
65;American Brown Ale;American Brown Ales are malty, slightly sweet and full of flavor. Aroma usually has caramel malt or nutty characteristics. Hop notes should be muted, although some examples have a mild citrus character due to the hop varieties used. Color should be brown to reddish-brown. ABV is usually in the 4% to 6.4% range. IBU range should be 24 to 45.
66;Winter Warmer;These malty sweet offerings tend to be a favorite winter seasonal. Big malt presence, both in flavor and body. The color ranges from brownish reds to nearly pitch black. Hop bitterness is generally low, leveled and balanced, but hop character can be pronounced. Alcohol warmth is not uncommon.
67;Smoked Beer;Not to be confused with a traditional Rauchbier, a Smoked Beer can be quiet a robust, even an overpowering beer, more so with versions that use peat smoked malt which carries a cloying smoked flavor that can ruin a beer in excess. Peat smoked malts are used in many other styles, like Scotch Ales in a liberal way though many American brewers use more typically in Porters. The flavor of peat smoke tends to be much stronger and more assertive so brewers use very modest amounts in the mash.
68;Dubbel;The Belgian Dubbel is a rich malty beer with some spicy / phenolic and mild alcoholic characteristics. Not as much fruitiness as the Belgian Strong Dark Ale but some dark fruit aromas and flavors may be present. Mild hop bitterness with no lingering hop flavors. It may show traits of a steely caramel flavor from the use of crystal malt or dark candy sugar. Look for a medium to full body with an expressive carbonation.
69;Flanders Red Ale;The Flanders Red Ale is a Belgian-style sour ale similar to the Flanders Brown Ale (or Oud Bruin). The style is highlighted by a strong sour aroma and taste and minimal hop presence. Much like the Flanders Brown Ale, this style also gets a long period of aging of a year or more. Aging for this style is often done in oak barrels, lending a further acid character to the style. Quite often, an aged batch is blended with a younger batch to balance the sour notes. The color should be dark red to brown, with a notable clarity. The aroma has strong fruit smells, like citrus, sour cherries and dark fruits. There should also be notes of vanilla from the oak aging, and sometimes has chocolate and malt notes as well. The sourness of the style should be apparent in the aroma. The taste follows the smell closely, with strong fruit flavors dominating along with the sourness and acidity. The feel should be medium bodied, with the acidity standing out. ABV should range from 4.6% to 6.5%. IBUs should be low, ranging from 10 to 25.
70;Dunkelweizen;"Similar to a Hefeweizen, these southern Germany wheat beers are brewed as darker versions (Dunkel means ""dark"") with deliciously complex malts and a low balancing bitterness. Most are brown and murky (from the yeast). The usual clove and fruity (banana) characters will be present, some may even taste like banana bread."
71;Roggenbier;A traditional German style rye beer that typically contains very large portions of rye. Expect a very pronounced spiciness and sour-like rye character, malty flavor, and a clean hop character. Often unfiltered and bottle-conditioned, Roggenbiers tend to be rather turbid and foamy.
72;Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier;A rather old, rare, and unique German beer style, Kellerbiers are unfiltered and unpasteurized lagers that date back to at least the Middle Ages. The beer is matured, unbunged (beer is exposed), in deep vaults. The final product is a smooth, naturally cloudy beer that's rich in vitamins (from the yeast). Hop bitterness can be high and alcohol will vary. Zwickel Bier is similar to a Keller, but not as pronounced.
73;Belgian Dark Ale;Belgian Darks offer a massive range of characters. Colors play within the amber to light brown to deep garnet hues, with thick, rocky heads of great retention. Aromas can be anywhere from traces of yeast, spiced, malty, floral and even slightly intoxicating. Flavors from dry and spiced, to sweet and malty. Most have a low level of bitterness.
74;Biere de Garde;The Biere de Garde is golden to deep copper or light brown in color. They are moderate to medium in body. This style of beer is characterized by a toasted malt aroma, slight malt sweetness in flavor, and medium hop bitterness. Noble-type hop aromas and flavors should be low to medium. Fruity esters can be light to medium in intensity. Flavor of alcohol is evident. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas and flavors are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived but chill haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character.
75;Japanese Rice Lager;Similar to Macro / Adjunct Lagers, wherein the beer's grist bill is cut by using large portions of rice, but not enough to be classified as Happoshu. Pale yellow in color, soft hop nose, and expect a rounded, firm malty character, moderate bitterness, and a trademark dry finish.
76;Black & Tan;This applies to pre-blended packaged beers, where a brewery will blend a dark ale with a light ale or lager. It's by no means a traditional style of beer, but rather brewers capitalizing on the concept practiced at bars where the beers are physically layered.
77;Irish Red Ale;Irish Red Ales get their distinctive color from the use of a small amount of roasted barley. They range in color from light red-amber to light red-brown. The aroma should have a notable caramel sweetness, with virtually no hop presence. The taste should likewise have a caramel malt sweetness, with little or no hop bitterness. The feel should have a medium body. ABV ranges from 4% to 4.5%. IBUs range from 20 to 30.
78;Chile Beer;Typically basic light colored ales, but sometimes lagers, brewers will add various hot pepper juice, oils, or actual peppers to the beer - jalape?o chiles being the most common pepper used. Hotness can range from a subtle spiciness to palate scorching.
79;English Stout;As mysterious as they look, stouts are typically dark brown to pitch black in color. A common profile amongst Stouts, but not in all cases, is the use of roasted barley (unmalted barley that is kilned to the point of being charred) which lends a dry character to the beer as well as a huge roasted flavor that can range from burnt to coffee to chocolate. A different balance of hops is up to the brewers preference, but the roasted character must be there.
80;Cream Ale;Cream Ales are mild and pale ales that use warm fermentation and cold lagering. The color should be light, ranging from a pale yellow to golden. The aroma should be very muted and hop notes are often absent. The taste should be similarly muted, with a crisp taste but a minimal hop and malt taste. The feel is light and clean, with a crisp finish. ABV ranges from 4% to 5.6%. IBUs are generally low and range from 10 to 20.
81;American Wild Ale;"Sometimes Belgian influenced, American Wild Ales are beers that are introduced to ""wild"" yeast or bacteria, such as: Brettanomyces (Brettanomyces Bruxellensis, Brettanomyces Lambicus or Brettanomyces Anomolus), Pediococcus or Lactobacillus. This introduction may occur from oak barrels that have been previously inoculated, pitched into the beer, or gained from various ""sour mash"" techniques. Regardless of which and how, these little creatures often leave a funky calling card that can be quite strange, interesting, pleasing to many, but also often deemed as undesirable by many."
82;American Double / Imperial Pilsner;Similar to a Pilsner in appearance, but expect a more pronounced malty backbone and an intense bitterness. Malt flavors tend to be quite sweet in many examples. Alcohol can be quite aggressive and lend some spicy notes to the flavor.
83;Scottish Gruit / Ancient Herbed Ale;This category recognizes the ancient ales. Beers of yore, the way beers were probably brewed throughout the Middle Ages in Continental Europe. Gruit is mainly a concoction of : sweet gale (Myrica gale), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and wild rosemary (Ledum palustre). Other herbs, spices, and berries might be used to create interesting and pleasant aroma and flavor of green- and herbal-tea. These ancient ales may be highly intoxicating and aphrodisiacal when consumed in significant quantity. Historically, it has been said to stimulate the mind, create euphoria, and enhance sexual drive.
84;Wheatwine;A Wheat Wine (also called an American Style Wheat Wine) is a stronger wheat beer that is brewed with 50% or more wheat malt. The color ranges from gold to dark amber. The style is full bodied and has a high malt sweetness. Hop presence should be medium to low in both aroma and flavor. Fruit tones should be noted in both aroma and taste. Other style notes include bready, wheat, honey or caramel notes. ABV should be in the range of 8% to 12%. IBUs are medium at 40-80, usually at the lower end of the range.
85;American Dark Wheat Ale;An Americanized version of a Dunkel Weizen, these beers can range within the brown to garnet range. Often cloudy with long-lasting heads. Light to medium body with high level of carbonation. Hop characters will be low to high with some fruitiness from ale fermentation, though most examples use of a fairly neutral ale yeast, resulting in a clean fermentation with little to no diacetyl. Flavors of caramel and toasted malts might be present.
86;American Malt Liquor;"For the most part, Malt Liquor beers are sold in the infamous 40 oz sized bottles. Straw to pale amber in color, most use excessive amounts of adjuncts, such as corn, rice, refined brewers sugar (dextrose) and as a result there are very few ""all malt"" brewed malt liquors. Hops are barely used, just enough is added to balance off any cloyingness. Higher alcohol versions tend to have a loads of fusel alcohol, which gives off solvent or fuel like aromas and flavors. They are attenuated very well, meaning a higher ratio of fermentable sugars are present over other beers, but without using as many ingredients and still ending up with a high alcohol content. Some breweries enable the use of special enzymes to further breakdown the malt and adjuncts so they will yield a larger percentage of alcohol. This makes for quite a dry beer, with only a small amount of unfermented sugars and a kick that will knock you on your ass."
87;Baltic Porter;The Baltic Porter is brewed with lager yeast, which gives a smooth cold-fermented beer with few of the ale characters. Color should be black to very dark red-brown. Aroma has caramel sugars, chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. Also, a slight smokiness may also be present. Taste should not have a strong bitterness from either hops or roasted malts. Alcohol is likely notable in the taste. A light cocoa powder, fruity and possibly a slight smoky flavor may also be notable. Hops should be minimal all around, in both aroma and taste. Feel should be medium to full, with a slight sweetness in the lingering aftertaste. ABV should range from 7% to 9% or higher. IBUs should range from 30 to 40.
88;Munich Helles Lager;"When the golden and clean lagers of Plzen (Bohemia) became all the rage in the mid-1800's, M?nchen brewers feared that Germans would start drinking the Czech beer vs. their own. Munich Helles Lager was their answer to meet the demand. A bit more malty, they often share the same spicy hop characters of Czech Pils, but are a bit more subdued and in balance with malts. ""Helles"" is German for ""bright."""
89;Kristalweizen;A filtered version of a Hefeweizen, showcasing bright and clear bodies from pale straw to light amber. Overall character will be more clean and softer on the palate, and the common banana and phenols will be more subtle.
90;English Pale Mild Ale;Similar to an ordinary bitter yet not as hoppy, the English Pale Mild Ale is a delicate malty brew. Hops are generally mild with a balancing bitterness. Fruitiness, sulfur and buttery diacetyl may be present. The low alcohol range makes this ale a perfect session brew.
91;Lambic - Fruit;In the case of Fruit Lambics, whole fruits are traditionally added after spontaneous fermentation has started. Kriek (cherries), Frambroise (raspberries), P???che (peach) and Cassis (black currant) are common fruits, all producing subtle to intense fruit characters respectively. Once the fruit is added, the beer is subjected to additional maturation before bottling. Malt and hop characters are generally low to allow the fruit to consume the palate. Alcohol content tends to be low.
92;Old Ale;An Old Ale (or Stock Ale) is a strong, dark and malty English style of beer. The color should range from dark amber to dark brown. The aroma should have minimal hop notes, with strong malt or caramel notes apparent. Strong alcohol aromas are also usually obvious. Fruity esters and other dark fruit aromas may also be very notable. A long period of aging also contributes to the character of the sharpness of the flavors. The taste is generally complex, with very minimal hop bitterness. There should be a notable bite from the alcohol though, along with notes of vanilla, dark fruits, caramel, and sherry. If the ale was aged in a barrel, tones from the barrel will be very apparent with wood, vanilla, bourbon or other flavors apparent. The feel should be full bodied. ABV should range from 6% to 9%. IBUs are medium and range from 30 to 65.
93;Quadrupel (Quad);Inspired by the Trappist brewers of Belgium, a Quadrupel is a Belgian style ale of great strength with bolder flavor compared to its Dubbel and Tripel sister styles. Typically a dark creation that ranges within the deep red, brown and garnet hues. Full bodied with a rich malty palate. Phenols are usually at a moderate level. Sweet with a low bitterness yet a well perceived alcohol
94;Braggot;The Braggot is quite an old drink, there is a mentioned in Chaucer, Canterbury Tales in the late 1300’s, and there are earlier references dating even further back to the 12th century in Ireland. Braggot is simply made by blending spices and herbs with mead and beer, to produce a strong concoction with uncommon flavors. Many taverns would make this blend right at the bar though brewers would also blend them as well.
95;Lambic - Unblended;A spontaneous fermented unblended ale that is indigenous to the Senne Valley of Belgium, a large portion of wheat brings out the crispness though the flavor is dominated with a unique tartness from the wild yeast and bacteria that inoculate the brew from both airborne and tainted barrels that they ferment in. Light bodied with little hop flavor or bitterness. Look for hard cider, white wine or similar tartness. Lambics are aged before consumption to ensure that the tartness has mellowed.
96;Eisbock;Eisbock was originally discovered in Kulmbach, Bavaria by removing ice from partially frozen barrels of beer. This is a traditional style that is typically made by freeze distilling a doppelbock and removing the resulting ice. This provides a concentrated flavor and boosts the alcohol (upwards of 12% to 14%).The color should be deep copper to dark brown. The aroma should be dominated by the malt characteristics, with malt sweetness very evident. Other smells like dark fruits, caramel and chocolate can be present. Hop aroma should be nonexistent. The taste should follow the aroma, with malty sweetness dominant. Other flavors like dark fruits, caramel, a hint of chocolate and toasted notes also can be evident. Also, alcohol should be very obvious in the taste. The feel should be full bodied. ABV should range from 8% to 14%. IBUs should be somewhat low in the range of 26 to 33.
97;Berliner Weissbier;Berliner Weisse is a top-fermented, bottle conditioned wheat beer made with both traditional warm-fermenting yeasts and lactobacillus culture. They have a rapidly vanishing head and a clear, pale golden straw-coloured appearance. The taste is refreshing, tart, sour and acidic, with a lemony-citric fruit sharpness and almost no hop bitterness.
98;Kvass;"Kvass is Russian for ""leaven"" and is a 16th century beer-like beverage made with grains - wheat, rye, barley, etc - or dark rye bread, and often has additions of sugars, birch sap, berries, fruits; the process is akin to ancient beer brewing. It's basically a fermentation of what's around with a simple bakers yeast. It's low in alcohol and often flavored with herbs or fruits to knock the bitter edge out."
99;Faro;A blended Lambic with the addition of candi sugar for a lighter, quite sweet and more palatable beer. Commonly spiced with pepper, orange peel and coriander.
100;Gueuze;Gueuze is a type of Belgian Lambic beer that is made by blending a younger lambic (1 year old) with an older lambic (2-3 years old). This is then bottled for a secondary fermentation in the bottle. Most examples of the Gueuze style can handle long periods of aging, with the Cantillon Lou Pepe label noting that it can be aged for up to 20 years. Kriek is a closely related lambic that uses sour cherries before bottling.The color should be pale yellow, and somewhat cloudy. The aroma should have a very strong sour presence, with notes of green apples, cider, citrus rind and a notable acidity. Some brewers add sugar to the fermentation to dull the sour edge of the style. The taste should follow the aroma, with sourness being the primary flavor. There should also be strong notes of citrus, acidity and possibly a very slight sweet aftertaste. Hop bitterness should not be noticed at all. The feel should be light, with very high carbonation. ABV should be from 5% to 6%. IBUs should be very low at 11 to 23.
101;Gose;"""Gose is a German wheat beer that was first brewed in the 1700s in the town of Goslar, Germany. It is also known as a traditional style in Leipzig, Germany. It is a top-fermented, """"pre-lager"""" beer style. The beers typically have a moderate alcohol content of 4 to 5% ABV. Dominant flavors in Gose include a lemon tartness, a herbal characteristic, and a strong saltiness (the result of either local water sources or added salt). Gose beers typically do not have prominent hop bitterness, flavors, or aroma."""
102;Happoshu;"Japanese beer companies produce what's called ""Happoshu,"" which is sparkling low malt beverage. Since the tax for Happoshu is much less than the tax for beer, happoshu is cheaper than beer. For that reason, Happoshu has become very popular in Japan. Happoshu classification occurs when an ingredient other than malt, hops, rice, corn, kaoliang, potato, starch, or sugar is used, or if the malt ratio is less than 67%."
