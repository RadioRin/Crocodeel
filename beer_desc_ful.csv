Altbier;"""Alt"" translates to ""old"" in German. So ""Altbier"" literally translated would be ""old beer"". Despite the connotations of a beer that is past its prime, the name actually derives from the continuing deference to Rhineland brewing traditions. Altbier is a top-fermented ale that is copper in color. It is unique because it undergoes a period of cold-conditioning or lagering. Due to that fact, this style is a hybrid of both ales and lagers. Despite the usually notable hop bitterness, the lagering gives a well-rounded beer with a clean flavor dominated by the malts. Most Altbiers are around 4% to 5% ABV. The normal IBU range is 25 to 52, with most at the lower end of that range.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Amber Kellerbier;Kellerbier, literally “cellar beer,” is a relatively unknown beer style in North America, yet in its home in Bavaria, Kellerbier ranks among the most popular beer garden brews. This beer is especially popular in Franconia, a region in southern Germany where the style originated. Franconia holds the distinction of having the greatest density of breweries in the world. There are about a hundred, mostly small, artisanal breweries and brewpubs within a 50-mile radius around Bamberg, the beer capital of Franconia, and many make Kellerbier or a closely related style, such as Zwickelbier or Zoiglbier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
American Amber Ale;American Amber Ales (or Red Ales) are a top-fermenting version of the American Amber Lager. This style has the red-copper color and semi-sweet flavor of the American Amber Lager. Due to the use of ale yeast, the aromas have slight traces of fruit. As a general rule, this style uses American hops that give it a minor citrus or grapefruit aroma and flavor. ABV is usually in the range of 4.5% to 6% and IBUs are generally between 30 and 40.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
American Barleywine;American Barleywines are a complex style that range from amber to dark copper in color. The mouthfeel is generally full and there is a notable malt sweetness, usually present as a caramel or toffee taste and smell. There is also a notable alcohol presence. Hop bitterness in the aroma and taste is medium to very high. ABV can range widely from 8% to 12% or higher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
American Brown Ale;American Brown Ales are malty, slightly sweet and full of flavor. Aroma usually has caramel malt or nutty characteristics. Hop notes should be muted, although some examples have a mild citrus character due to the hop varieties used. Color should be brown to reddish-brown. ABV is usually in the 4% to 6.4% range. IBU range should be 24 to 45.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
American IPA;The American India Pale Ale (IPA) style has an extremely notable hop presence in both aroma and taste. The hop character is always front and center and notable as a floral or citrus character that is quite strong. The color should be light gold to copper and the the feel should be medium with moderate carbonation. The malt character of the style is generally subordinated to the hops. ABV is usually in the range of 5% to 8% and IBUs range from 50 to 70 or higher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
American Lager;"American All-Malt Lagers refer to a broadly defined style where the brewer does not use cereal adjuncts (that means rice or corn in the boil/mash for the laypersons amongst us). Due to that fact, the malt character of this style will be stronger. This style is often pale in color, with a notable carbonation. It also shows more notable bitterness than other ""Macro"" lagers that use cereal adjuncts.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
American Light Lager;The Light Lager is very pale in color and light in aroma and taste. Hop presence in aroma and taste should be very low to nonexistent. Light fruity esters are sometimes present. The feel should be very light and the carbonation should be high. ABV should be 3.5% to 4.4%. IBUs are very low at 5 to 10.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
American Pale Ale;American Pale Ales vary widely in color, aroma and taste. Color is generally deep copper (amber) to light copper. Aroma generally has very notable floral or citrus hop notes.

American Stout;The American Stout is highlighted by a dark brown to black color. Head retention should be notable also. Aroma has pronounced tones of caramel, chocolate, coffee and a very notable roasted smell. Taste has notable coffee and roasted bitterness, with low to medium hop tones. Any hop tones are usually highlighted by subdued citrus notes. Feel should be medium to full bodied. ABV can range from 5% to 9% and higher. IBUs should range from 30 to 60.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
American Strong Ale;"The term American Strong Ale is usually used as a ""catch-all"" category for any dark and strong beers that defy a traditional beer style description. This ""style"" shares characteristics with several beers style, including barleywines, old ales and even Double IPAs. Most examples of the style are dark in color, from dark amber to almost black. Hop presence in aroma and flavor can vary widely within the style. One notable factor of most examples of the style is a relatively high ABV, usually 7% or higher.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
American Wheat Beer;An Americanized version of a Hefe Weizen, these beers range within the pale to golden range in color. Reminiscent of a Hefe Weizen in appearance, unless filtered. Long-lasting head with a light to medium body, higher carbonation is proper. German Weizen flavors and aromas of banana esters and clove-like phenols will not be found. Most use a substantial percentage of wheat malt. Hop character will be low to high but most are moderate in bitterness. There may be some fruitiness from ale fermentation though most examples use of a fairly neutral ale yeast, resulting in a clean fermentation with little to no diacetyl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Australian Sparkling Ale;"A beer style once popular in Australia, especially in the Adelaide area. Today, the only widely available commercial example is Coopers Sparkling Ale.
Coopers Sparkling Ale is a refreshing, golden ale that is top-fermented, displaying fruity aromas, a malt driven palate and a clean finish. Sparkling ale is bottle-conditioned to a high degree of carbonation, and the yeast is usually roused before serving, giving the beer a hefeweizen-like cloudiness in the glass.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Baltic Porter;The Baltic Porter is brewed with lager yeast, which gives a smooth cold-fermented beer with few of the ale characters. Color should be black to very dark red-brown. Aroma has caramel sugars, chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. Also, a slight smokiness may also be present. Taste should not have a strong bitterness from either hops or roasted malts. Alcohol is likely notable in the taste. A light cocoa powder, fruity and possibly a slight smoky flavor may also be notable. Hops should be minimal all around, in both aroma and taste. Feel should be medium to full, with a slight sweetness in the lingering aftertaste. ABV should range from 7% to 9% or higher. IBUs should range from 30 to 40.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Belgian Blond Ale;The Belgian Blonde Ale is similar to a Tripel. The color should be pale yellow. The flavor should be slightly sweet and less complex than many other pale Belgian styles. The typical Belgian spiciness should only be minimally apparent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Belgian Dark Strong Ale;Belgian Strong Dark Ales range in color from amber to dark brown. The aroma has notes of dark candy sugar, mild dark fruits and roasted malts. Hop presence should be minimal. The taste also has a low hop presence, with roasted malts and dark fruits standing out. There may also be a mild hint of residual sugar sweetness, which can offset the usual alcohol notes. This style generally holds up well to secondary flavor additions, and some brewers will flavor the beer with spices, chocolate or other strong flavors. The feel is generally medium to full. ABV ranges from 7% to 11% or higher. IBUs are low to medium and range from 20 to 50.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Belgian Dubbel;The Belgian Dubbel is a medium bodied, dark beer with a malt and nut sweetness. The color is dark amber to dark red-brown. Head retention is usually notable. Aroma should have sweet malts, nuts, chocolate and a mild roasted smell. The aroma may also have a hint of dark fruits or cocoa powder. Hop notes in the aroma are minimal if apparent at all. The taste has low bitterness and virtually no hop flavors. Other flavors include those similar to the aroma - dark fruits, chocolate, mild roasted notes, cocoa powder and malt sweetness. ABV ranges from 6% to 7.5% and can be higher. IBUs are low and range from 20 to 30.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Belgian Golden Strong Ale;The Belgian golden ale is a fairly recent development, considering the ancient roots of Belgian brewing. It evolved only about a hundred years ago. The brewers in Belgium came up with the golden ale probably because they had to, not because they were itching to add yet another creation to the sheer endless spectrum of their brews;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Belgian IPA;"The Belgian IPA combines the hoppy character of the American IPA style with the spicy notes or fruity esters of many Belgian styles. The base style that is usually used is a Tripel. Therefore, the color tends to be lighter colored and higher in alcohol. Since this is essentially a ""Euro IPA"", brewers tend to use European hop varieties in the brewing process. This gives it a somewhat more subdued hop profile when compared to American IPAs.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Belgian Pale Ale;Belgian Pale Ales are light to medium ales that have a mild aroma and low hops bitterness. The color is usually light golden to amber in color, occasionally even a darker amber. The aroma has minimal hops notes, with a mild malt and fruity sweetness. There may even be a mild spicy tone in the aroma. The taste also has minimal hops bitterness. The mild malt sweetness is also notable in the flavor, along with a minor caramel or toasted grain taste. Feel should be on the low to medium side. ABV ranges from 4% to 6%. IBUs are generally low and range from 20 to 30.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Belgian Tripel;Belgian Tripels are highlighted by complex, spicy flavors. The color is generally pale to medium golden. The aroma has fruity/banana esters, with notes of sweetness and spices. The taste has balanced malt and hop notes, with a slightly sweet finish. The taste should also have subtle but notable alcohol presence. Feel should be medium bodied. Due to the high alcohol content, this style also tends to age well over a period of years. ABV should range from 7% to 10% or slightly higher. IBUs should be somewhat low, in the range of 25 to 35.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Berliner Weisse;The Berliner Weisse is a favorite summer wheat beer style for many fans of the microbeer hobby. It is characterized by light color, taste and feel. The color should be very pale golden, with a notable cloudiness. The unique combination of yeast and acids in fermentation give this style its signature tones of citrus and slight acidity. The aroma and taste have notable tones of lemon and citrus. Hop notes should not be present in either aroma or taste. There may also be a slight residual sweetness in the taste. The feel is highlighted by a high level of carbonation, but is very light bodied, which lends itself to being a summer beer. ABV should be fairly low in the range of 2.8% to 3.5%. IBUs should be similarly very low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Best Bitter;The English Session or Ordinary Bitter is pale gold to copper in color. The aroma is mild with a semi-sweet grain smell, occasionally having notable but not strong hop notes. Notes of butterscotch may also be present. The taste is equally muted, with hops somewhat subdued and a slight sweetness. The feel should be equally muted with light or medium body. The bottom line is that this style is a session beer and should be light enough to drink multiple pints in a sitting. ABV should range from 3% to 3.7%. IBUs should be somewhat low, from 20 to 35;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Biere de Garde;"Bi?re de Garde translates to ""keeping beer"" in French. Similar to Saison in its history, these beers were usually brewed in the winter and spring, and cellared for a time after bottling. They were originally intended for drinking later in the year. The color ranges widely from golden to copper to brown to almost black. The aroma has notes of toasted malts along with a slight malt sweetness and a slightly ""bready or yeasty"" smell. It should also have low to medium hop bitterness. The taste should also show similar toasted malts and malt sweetness, along with the ""yeasty"" taste. Alcohol should also be evident. The feel should be light to medium. ABV should be in the range of 4.5% to 8%. IBUs should be around 25 to 35.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Black IPA;The Black IPA is typically an IPA brewed with dark malts and has a darker color than the standard India Pale Ale. The color should range from dark brown to black. Along with the usual highly notable hop notes in an IPA, there should also be notable malt and roasted grain flavors. ABV usually ranges from 4% to 10%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Blonde Ale;Dry, light to medium body with light malty sweetness. Low to medium hop bitterness with minimal aroma. Slight fruit flavor. Light yellow to golden blonde color with no chill haze. Med to high carbonation. All malt, dry, crisp beer approximating a lager in overall character. Enjoying a resurgence at many microbreweries as an alternative to American style lagers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
British Brown Ale;"The term ""English Brown Ale"" encompasses a range of styles that include Nut Brown Ales, certain mild ales and several differing styles that use dark or brown malts in the brewing process. The color should be dark copper to brown. The aroma is highlighted by roasted, caramel or other dark malts. This lends a malty sweetness. Fruit notes, sometimes bananas or sweetness, should also be apparent. Very little to no hop notes should be present. The taste should have should have an equal malt sweetness, with notes of fruity esters and toasted or roasted tones as well. The feel should medium, with a dry sweetness. ABV ranges from 4% to 5.5%. IBUs should be low, ranging from 15 to 25.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
British Golden Ale;Well-hopped, quenching beer with an emphasis on showcasing hops. Served colder than traditional bitters, this style was originally positioned as a refreshing summer beer, but is now often brewed year-round. Although early on the beers were brewed with English hops, increasingly American citrus-flavored hops are used. Golden Ales are also called Golden Bitters, Summer Ales, or British Blonde Ales. Can be found in cask, keg, and bottle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
British Strong Ale;English Strong Ale is a strong pale ale with ABV usually above 5%. The malt sweetness and fruity esters are far more obvious than the hop tones. The color should be pale amber to medium red-brown. Aroma should highlight the malt tones, with caramel and sweetness apparent. The taste should equally concentrate on the malts, with caramel and sweetness apparent as in the aroma. The feel should be medium to full bodied. ABV should range from 7% to 11%. IBUs should range from 30 to 65.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Brown IPA;The modern English IPA has a medium hop bitterness, with medium alcohol content. The bitterness level is notably less than the American IPA. The color should be pale gold to dark copper. The aroma should have a decently strong hop profile, with a flowery essence and many hop varieties possibly used to create an herbal hop character. The taste should be highlighted by the hops with medium levels of malt sweetness. The feel should be crisp and dry. ABV should range from 5% to 7%. IBUs should be mid-range from 35 to 63.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
California Common;California Common Beer varies in color from light to dark amber. The aroma usually has smells of caramel, grains and low hop notes. The taste follows the smell, and has caramel malt tastes along with minor hop bitterness. The feel should be medium. ABV ranged from 4% to 5.5%. IBUs are in the middle of the range at 35 to 45. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cream Ale;Cream Ales are mild and pale ales that use warm fermentation and cold lagering. The color should be light, ranging from a pale yellow to golden. The aroma should be very muted and hop notes are often absent. The taste should be similarly muted, with a crisp taste but a minimal hop and malt taste. The feel is light and clean, with a crisp finish. ABV ranges from 4% to 5.6%. IBUs are generally low and range from 10 to 20.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Czech Amber Lager;The style can be similar to a Vienna lager but with Saazer-type hop character, or that approaching an English bitter but significantly richer with more of a deep caramel character. Large brewery versions are generally similar to Czech Premium Pale Lager with slightly darker malt flavors and less hop, while smaller breweries often make versions with considerable hop character, malt complexity, or residual sweetness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Czech Dark Lager;"This dark lager starts off by offering up flavours of toasted bread and nuts, roasted grains and a slight hint of chocolate. Restrained treacle sweetness surfaces mid-sip, with faint woodsmoke and coffee grounds; finishes with an herbal, earthy hop bitterness with just a touch of spice - not unlike their flagship pilsener, though the dark malts give this one a more robust flavour that lasts to the finish, and lingers thereafter. Fairly light in body, with a smooth texture and relatively mild carbonation that gently nudges the surface of the palate. Highly drinkable, with a balanced, approachable flavour profile.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Czech Pale Lager;While called a pale lager, the actual color is more golden (light gold to deep gold) rather than straw or yellow. The deep gold color can almost touch the amber range. A white, per-sistent head is characteristic, and the clarity is normally good (maybe not quite as clear as German Pils examples). The body is in the medium-light to medium range, again a bit more than German counterparts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Czech Premium Pale Lager;Rich, characterful, pale Czech lager, with considerable malt and hop character and a long, rounded finish. Complex yet well-balanced and refreshing. The malt flavors are complex for a Pilsner-type beer, and the bitterness is strong but clean and without harshness, which gives a rounded impression that enhances drinkability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Dark Mild;The quintessential British session beer, like its name suggests, a Mild is known for its low level of hops character. Alcohol content is traditionally very low. Grainy to toasty malts might be present, but expect some body from the high dextrins produced in brewing. Low carbonation with a near still, bubbly head. Colors can range from gold to dark brown. Traditionally a draft beer made popular in London and the Midlands of England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Doppelbock;"Doppelbock (translates to ""double bock"" in German) is a Bavarian beer style that was yet another German style to find its origins by being brewed by monks in centuries past. Along with bocks in general, it was considered ""liquid bread"" by the monks in times of fasting. The color should range from dark copper to dark brown, but can sometimes be somewhat pale. The aroma should have have a very strong malt sweetness present, with toasted grains notable. Alcohol aroma may also be present. Finally, there may also be hints of chocolate and dark fruits. The taste should also center on the malts, with toasted bread notes and a somewhat notable alcohol taste. There should also be a semi-sweet or outright sweet malt taste, and very little or no hop flavors. The feel should be full bodied. ABV ranges from 6% to 10%. IBUs should be fairly low between 17 to 27.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Double IPA;"Take an India Pale Ale and feed it steroids, ergo the term Double IPA. Although open to the same interpretation as its sister styles, you should expect something robust, malty, alcoholic and with a hop profile that might rip your tongue out. The Imperial usage comes from Russian Imperial stout, a style of strong stout originally brewed in England for the Russian Imperial Court of the late 1700s; though Double IPA is often the preferred name.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Dunkles Bock;"The term ""dunkel"" is the German word for ""dark"". In general, the ""style"" covers a range of lager beers that are notably darker than the other German lager styles. The color should range from medium amber to red-brown. Like many other dark beers, the malts should overshadow the hops in the aroma and flavor.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Dunkles Weissbier;"Dunkel Weizen translates to ""dark wheat"" in German. This dark wheat ale is a great fall and winter style, as it has strong flavors of sweet or semi-sweet malts and mild roasted qualities. The color should be copper to dark brown. The aroma should have distinct malt sweetness and chocolate and roasted qualities. Hop aroma should not be notable. The flavor should follow the aroma, with malts very dominant in sweetness and roasted flavors. Hop flavor should also be mostly absent. The feel should be medium to strong and should be fairly well carbonated. ABV should range from 4.8% to 5.4%. IBUs should be low and range from 10 to 15.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Eisbock;Eisbock was originally discovered in Kulmbach, Bavaria by removing ice from partially frozen barrels of beer. This is a traditional style that is typically made by freeze distilling a doppelbock and removing the resulting ice. This provides a concentrated flavor and boosts the alcohol (upwards of 12% to 14%).The color should be deep copper to dark brown. The aroma should be dominated by the malt characteristics, with malt sweetness very evident. Other smells like dark fruits, caramel and chocolate can be present. Hop aroma should be nonexistent. The taste should follow the aroma, with malty sweetness dominant. Other flavors like dark fruits, caramel, a hint of chocolate and toasted notes also can be evident. Also, alcohol should be very obvious in the taste. The feel should be full bodied. ABV should range from 8% to 14%. IBUs should be somewhat low in the range of 26 to 33.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
English Barleywine;The English Barleywine is generally a less bitter version of the American Barleywine. Hop notes are subdued because English hop varieties are usually (but not always) used in the style. Like the American Barleywine, this basic barleywine style is intended to be appreciated for the complexity of the flavors. The high alcohol content generally means that it can be aged for long periods, sometimes many years.The color should range from medium copper to Dark brown to black in some examples. The aroma should be very strong and dominated by the high malty sweetness. There should also be notes of fruits, toasted grains and caramel. Alcohol notes should be strong. Hop notes should be very subdued or nonexistent. The taste should also be dominated by the malts and alcohol, similar to the aroma. The feel should be very full bodied. ABV generally ranges from 8% to 12% and sometimes considerably higher. IBUs should range from 40 to 60.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
English IPA;The modern English IPA has a medium hop bitterness, with medium alcohol content. The bitterness level is notably less than the American IPA. The color should be pale gold to dark copper. The aroma should have a decently strong hop profile, with a flowery essence and many hop varieties possibly used to create an herbal hop character. The taste should be highlighted by the hops with medium levels of malt sweetness. The feel should be crisp and dry. ABV should range from 5% to 7%. IBUs should be mid-range from 35 to 63. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
English Porter;The English Porter has a history dating back to 1721, when it was first mentioned. The color of the English Porter should range from light brown to dark brown, almost black. The aroma should have a strong malt presence, with notes of chocolate, coffee, and roasted grains. The taste should focus on the malts, with roasted malts, toffee, caramel and nutty tones present. Other flavors may include coffee, bready yeast and toasted rye bread. Hop presence in both aroma and flavor should be minimal. The feel should be medium bodied. ABV ranges from 4% to 5.4%. IBUs should range from 18 to 35.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Festbier;Friendship and camaraderie: the two keys to any festive event. And then there’s the beer. It should be full-bodied, yet infinitely smooth. Seductively malty, with a kiss of the hops for balance. This is our Festbier. Painstakingly crafted from German malts, decoction brewed for full flavor and carefully aged for depth of character. Gather with your friends for a festive moment of Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flanders Red Ale;The Flanders Red Ale is a Belgian-style sour ale similar to the Flanders Brown Ale (or Oud Bruin). The style is highlighted by a strong sour aroma and taste and minimal hop presence. Much like the Flanders Brown Ale, this style also gets a long period of aging of a year or more. Aging for this style is often done in oak barrels, lending a further acid character to the style. Quite often, an aged batch is blended with a younger batch to balance the sour notes. The color should be dark red to brown, with a notable clarity. The aroma has strong fruit smells, like citrus, sour cherries and dark fruits. There should also be notes of vanilla from the oak aging, and sometimes has chocolate and malt notes as well. The sourness of the style should be apparent in the aroma. The taste follows the smell closely, with strong fruit flavors dominating along with the sourness and acidity. The feel should be medium bodied, with the acidity standing out. ABV should range from 4.6% to 6.5%. IBUs should be low, ranging from 10 to 25.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Foreign Extra Stout;The Foreign or Extra Stout is similar to a Dry Stout in that they have a malty sweetness and notes of caramel. They also have a dry finish with a slight roasted bitterness. The color should be dark brown to black. The aroma should have a decent malt sweetness, caramel, roasted grains, and a slight coffee smell. The taste should mirror the aroma, with roasted malts, caramel, coffee and a very slight bitterness. There may also be a hint of chocolate or cocoa powder. The feel should be medium to full bodied. ABV ranges from 5.7% to 7.5%. IBUs should be between 30 to 60.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Fruit Lambic;A Fruit Beer is a beer brewed with a fruit or vegetable in the mash or with flavoring added in the fermentation. The most recognized example of a Fruit Beer is probably the Belgian Lambic. Fr?li is a fruit beer made from 70% wheat beer and 30% fruit juice. The most notable example of Vegetable Beers are probably Pumpkin Ales. Other examples include Chili Beer and other beers that use vegetable additions.The color, aroma and taste of the style ranges widely based on the fruit or vegetable additions in the brewing or fermenting process as well as the base beer style used. The color can range from pale yellow to dark brown. The aroma should have strong notes of the fruit or vegetable used, with hop notes minimal or nonexistent. The taste should follow the aroma, with hop bitterness most likely not apparent. There may also be notable acidity in some examples of the styles. The feel ranges from crisp and light to medium bodied. ABV ranges widely depending on the base beer style, from 2.5% to 12% or higher. IBUs also vary widely depending on the base beer style, and range from very low (5) to somewhat high (70).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
German Helles Exportbier;Helles is among the few beer styles with a definite birthday. The Spaten Brewery of Munich shipped the first cask of it on March 21, 1894. Interestingly, the destination was not a local beerhall, as you might have suspected. Rather, it was the far-away port city of Hamburg, in Prussian territory, on the North Sea. The Bavarians and the Prussians have never been too fond of each other. So Spaten did what we would now call test marketing. If the beer flopped among the Prussians near the ocean, none of its regular brown-lager drinkers at home, near the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, would take notice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
German Leichtbier;"German Leichtbier, or “light beer” is one of the lowest selling beers in the whole of Germany. You see, German palates apparently don’t follow American trends. They don’t care that Bud Light is the best selling name in beer. Well, they might, but that doesn’t make them want to fork over their hard earned Euros for a pint that hovers just above the non-alcoholic threshold.
Alright – so 2%-3.5% is significantly above .5%, but you get the idea. By the way, in case you were wondering, it’s pronounced LYSHT. Lie and sht – like you’re telling your yappy dog to cork it Cesar Millan style.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
German Pils;The German Pilsener is pale yellow to gold in color. The aroma is somewhat muted, but dominated by the hops. There should also be a notable malty sweetness in the smell. The taste should also be dominated by a notable hop bitterness, but is should not be overwhelming. A mild malt sweetness should also be apparent. The feel should be medium bodied. ABV should range from 4% to 5%. IBUs should be between 30 to 40.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Gose;"Gose is a German wheat beer that was first brewed in the 1700s in the town of Goslar, Germany. It is also known as a traditional style in Leipzig, Germany. It is a top-fermented, ""pre-lager"" beer style. The beers typically have a moderate alcohol content of 4 to 5% ABV. Dominant flavors in Gose include a lemon tartness, a herbal characteristic, and a strong saltiness (the result of either local water sources or added salt). Gose beers typically do not have prominent hop bitterness, flavors, or aroma.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Gueuze;Gueuze is a type of Belgian Lambic beer that is made by blending a younger lambic (1 year old) with an older lambic (2-3 years old). This is then bottled for a secondary fermentation in the bottle. Most examples of the Gueuze style can handle long periods of aging, with the Cantillon Lou Pepe label noting that it can be aged for up to 20 years. Kriek is a closely related lambic that uses sour cherries before bottling.The color should be pale yellow, and somewhat cloudy. The aroma should have a very strong sour presence, with notes of green apples, cider, citrus rind and a notable acidity. Some brewers add sugar to the fermentation to dull the sour edge of the style. The taste should follow the aroma, with sourness being the primary flavor. There should also be strong notes of citrus, acidity and possibly a very slight sweet aftertaste. Hop bitterness should not be noticed at all. The feel should be light, with very high carbonation. ABV should be from 5% to 6%. IBUs should be very low at 11 to 23.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Helles Bock;The Maibock style of beer tends to be lighter in color than other Bock beers and often has a significant hop character with a noticeable alcohol around the same as a traditional Bock. Maibocks are customarily served in the spring and are oftentimes interrelated with spring festivals and celebrations more often in the month of May.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Imperial Stout;The American Double (or Imperial) Stout is one style that virtually every microbeer fan knows well. The style is a derivative of the Russian Imperial Stout and therefore has the same robust flavor and feel. It has a very notable malt character to go along with the very dark or black color. There also should be hints of dark fruits, chocolate, roasted grains and other strong aromas and flavors. This style lends itself to strong flavor additions like chocolate and coffee. The alcohol content of the style is almost always high. Hop bitterness is also usually more notable than other stout styles, but is balanced well with the sweetness, roastiness and richness of the malt character. ABV is usually in the range of 7% to 12% or higher. IBUs are usually from 50 to 80.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
International Amber Lager;"Some people love the color and briskness of the fall season; others are sorry to see the slide into winter. However you view the coming of the cold months, the beers of fall, with their autumnal colors and warm, comforting maltiness can be reason enough to look forward to the season.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
International Dark Lager;Tip Back a Bock. Brewed with rich roasted barley malt and German specialty hops, this lighlty hopped American-style dark lager always goes down easy. Originally a seasonal beer, fans have demanded it year-round since 1973.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
International Pale Lager;No matter where one is in the world, a quenching pale lager is seldom far away. Nearly every country that has a brewery has one, which in many cases is considered the national beer. The far-reaching consequences of these German- and Bohemian-inspired brews is significant not only as a satiating provision, but often as a sort of identity. Many European breweries adopted the style and shifted their focus in response to the popularity of the originals a century and a half ago. The rest of the world followed closely behind. Most resemble pilsners with a modest hop character, yet other versions rely more on a malt background reminiscent of a helles lagerbier. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Irish Extra Stout;Our Irish-Style Extra Stout amplifies the traditional drier versions from Ireland for a bolder, black brew. The addition of both roasted barley and Dark Crystal malted barley give Extra Stout undertones of chocolate, molasses and dried fruit. The beer is generously hopped with East Kent Goldings to balance the sweetness from the malted barley. Extra Stout is a descendent of the British and Irish porters of the 18th Century. These strong porters eventually became known as strong stout, then Foreign Stout or Extra Stout, depending on origin. Extra Stouts were exported world-wide, gaining popularity in the West Indies, Africa and parts of Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Irish Red Ale;Irish Red Ales get their distinctive color from the use of a small amount of roasted barley. They range in color from light red-amber to light red-brown. The aroma should have a notable caramel sweetness, with virtually no hop presence. The taste should likewise have a caramel malt sweetness, with little or no hop bitterness. The feel should have a medium body. ABV ranges from 4% to 4.5%. IBUs range from 20 to 30.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Irish Stout;"One of the most common stouts, Dry Irish Stout tend to have light-ish bodies to keep them on the highly drinkable side. They're usually a lower carbonation brew and served on a nitro system for that creamy, masking effect. Bitterness comes from both roasted barley and a generous dose of hops, though the roasted character will be more noticeable. Examples of the style are, of course, the big three, Murphy's, Beamish, and Guinness, however there are many American brewed Dry Stouts that are comparable, if not better.

Kolsch;"K?lsch is a local specialty in Cologne, Germany. It has less hop bitterness that other German styles, and is more related in brewing style to Altbier (top-fermented at a warmer temperature and lagered). The color of a ""true"" K?lsch should be pale yellow to straw gold. The aroma has notes of subtle wheat/malt sweetness and possibly a light fruit tone. Low hop notes should be apparent. The taste should also have a subtle wheat/malt sweetness, with a slight hop bitterness that may mot be apparent in the smell. The feel should be light and crisp. ABV should be 4.8% to 5.3%. IBUs should be low at 18 to 25.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kentucky Common;Kentucky Common is a modern interpretation of an ale style native to pre-prohibition Louisville. Historically the beer was dark in color, creamy, and tart as a result of the introduction of lactobacillus bacteria by sour mashing. Local Option Bierkwerker took up the task of brewing this once familiar style - electing to use specialty grains rather than a large percentage of corn - yielding an adventurous taste profile befitting both conventional and courageous palates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Lambic;"An unblended Lambic is a very sour beer that is difficult to find outside Belgium. The color should be pale lemon yellow, with a notable cloudiness. The aroma should have an intense sour tone, with a notable acidity. Malt sweetness should not be present, and hop notes should also not be present. The taste should be equally sour, with notes of green apples, citrus rind bitterness and a ""barnyard funk"" taste from the Brettanomyces yeast. Some would describe ""barnyard funk"" as hay, leather and grassy characteristics. The feel should be very dry and light bodied. ABV is 5% to 6%. IBUs are very low, at 11 to 23.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Lichtenhainer;Lichtenhainer is also a pale beer brewed from lightly smoked malt, though only barley malt is used. The approximately 8? Plato wort is very lightly hopped and only boiled very briefly and exposed to either a spontaneously appearing or deliberately started lactic acid bacteria infection that gives the beer its weakly sour taste. The mostly young beer, which isn’t expected to be clear, is usually served from a barrel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
London Brown Ale;English brown ales range from beers such as Manns Original Brown Ale, which is quite sweet and low in alcohol, to northeastern brown ale such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. North American examples include Sam Adams Brown Ale and Brooklyn Brown Ale. They range from deep amber to brown in colour. Caramel and chocolate flavours are evident. Brown ales from northeastern England tend to be strong and malty, often nutty, while those from southern England are usually darker, sweeter and lower in alcohol. North American brown ales are usually drier than their English counterparts, with a slight citrus accent and an aroma, bitterness, and medium body due to American hop varieties. Fruitiness from esters are subdued. When chilled to cold temperatures, some haziness may be noticed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Marzen;M?rzen (or Oktoberfest) beers are made in a range of colors from gold to red-orange. The aroma should be dominated by a sweet malty smell. This should also have notes of lightly toasted grains. Also, there are usually bready yeast notes in the smell. The taste is equally dominated by the malts and malt sweetness and toasted notes. But there should also be a low but clean hop bitterness. The feel should be medium bodied. ABV ranges from 5.3% to 5.9%. IBUs should range from 18 to 25.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Munich Dunkel;The Munich Dunkel Lager should range in color from light brown to dark brown. The aroma should be dominated by slight malt sweetness with a slight hop bitterness also apparent. The sweetness should not be overly strong though, with a balance between the malt sweetness and hop bitterness. There should also be bready yeast tones in the aroma from the Munich dark malts. The taste should have chocolate notes, with roasted malts and noble hops apparent. A slight bready yeast taste may also be present, as in the aroma. The feel should light to medium bodied. ABV should range from 4.5% to 5%. IBUs should be low, from 16 to 25.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Munich Helles;The Munich Helles Lager is a light colored lager originally from Munich, Germany. The color for the style should be pale, usually pale yellow to golden. The aroma should have very low hop tones and bitterness, with a malty or grassy sweetness slightly apparent. A slight bready yeast tone should also be notable. The aroma should be somewhat muted. The taste Should also have a low hop bitterness. A mild malt sweetness should be notable, along with a bready yeast flavor. Lightly toasted malts are usually noted as well. The feel should be medium bodied. ABV should range from 4.5% to 5.5%. IBUs should be low, from 18 to 25.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Oatmeal Stout;Oatmeal Stouts are a Stout style with oats added to the brewing process. Normally, there is a maximum of 30% oats added to the grains. The color should be the same as other Stout styles, usually very dark brown or even black. The aroma should have a rich roasted malt character, with notes of caramel and chocolate. There should also be notable coffee or roasted barley smells, usually apparent as chocolate or nut smells. The taste should be smooth and full, with coffee-like bitterness apparent but not overwhelming. Roasted notes of malts and barley should be apparent also. Hop aroma and taste should be very low. Feel should be medium to full bodied. ABV ranges from 3.8% to 6% and sometimes higher. IBUs range from 20 to 40.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Old Ale;An Old Ale (or Stock Ale) is a strong, dark and malty English style of beer. The color should range from dark amber to dark brown. The aroma should have minimal hop notes, with strong malt or caramel notes apparent. Strong alcohol aromas are also usually obvious. Fruity esters and other dark fruit aromas may also be very notable. A long period of aging also contributes to the character of the sharpness of the flavors. The taste is generally complex, with very minimal hop bitterness. There should be a notable bite from the alcohol though, along with notes of vanilla, dark fruits, caramel, and sherry. If the ale was aged in a barrel, tones from the barrel will be very apparent with wood, vanilla, bourbon or other flavors apparent. The feel should be full bodied. ABV should range from 6% to 9%.

Notes of butterscotch may also be present. The taste is equally muted, with hops somewhat subdued and a slight sweetness. The feel should be equally muted with light or medium body. The bottom line is that this style is a session beer and should be light enough to drink multiple pints in a sitting. ABV should range from 3% to 3.7%. IBUs should be somewhat low, from 20 to 35.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Oud Bruin;The Flemish term Oud Bruin (old brown) always conjures up images in my mind of the picturesque cities of Brugge and Ghent, the two capitals of the modern Belgian provinces of West and East Flanders, respectively. Brugge means bridge in Flemish. In medieval times, between the 12th and 16th century, these two cities were fierce rivals, economically, politically and culturally. Both were textile centers and both were members of the Hanseatic League, a formal alliance of dozens of mercantile cities throughout Northern Europe that traded in anything of value, including wine, oil, grain, leather, cloth, copper, iron, dry goods, spices, salt and beer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Pale Kellerbier;A young, fresh Helles, so while still a malty, fully-attenuated Pils malt showcase, the hop character (aroma, flavor and bitterness) is more pronounced, and the beer is cloudy, often with some level of diacetyl, and possibly has some green apple and/or other yeast-derived notes. As with the traditional Helles, the Keller version is still a beer intended to be drunk by the liter, so overall it should remain a light, refreshing, easy drinking golden lager.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Piwo Grodziskie;It was named after the Polish town of Grodzisk Wielkopolski or Gr?tz in German. Our historic version is brewed according to the German Purity Law with air-dried barley malt and beech smoked wheat malt and hopped with Perle and Saaz. A sour mash is created using the old and forgotten technique called “Digerieren.” Finally a three month aging and maturation process creates a complex sour, smoky and heavily hopped wheat ale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Rauchbier;Rauchbier is a German smoked beer. The color should be dark copper to dark brown. The aroma should have a combination of smoke and malts. The smoked aroma should be very notable also. The taste follows the aroma. There should be a blend of smoke and malts, with the smoke flavors obvious. Smoked cheeses are similar in character. There should also be a slight malt sweetness apparent. Hop bitterness should be minimally apparent in both aroma and taste. The feel should be medium bodied. ABV ranged from 4.8% to 6%. IBUs range from 20 to 30.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Red IPA;Primarily a catch all for any beer less than a Dark Ale in color, ranging from amber (duh) to deep red hues. This style of beer tends to focus on the malts, but hop character can range from low to high. Expect a balanced beer, with toasted malt characters and a light fruitiness in most examples. The range can run from a basic ale, to American brewers who brew faux-Oktoberfest style beers that are actually ales instead of lagers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Rye IPA;Serious hop bitterness, along with an unyielding grapefruit bouquet from the Amarillo dry hop, balances the malty richness of four varieties of imported Belgian caramel malts. Pours a spectacular crimson with a creamy tan head. A generous addition of rye malt accentuates a spicy, crisp finish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Saison;The Saison (or Farmhouse Ale) is a French/Belgian style. It ranges in color from gold to dark amber. They are light to medium in body. The dominant quality in the aroma should be fruity esters, with hints of malt sweetness, spices, a slight sour character, and minimal alcohol. Hop presence in both aroma and flavor can vary widely within the style, from low to medium-high. Spice notes should be evident in both aroma and flavor, usually presenting as black pepper hints. Fruit flavors like dark fruits and bananas should also be noted, along with a very minimal hint of sour. ABV should range from 4.5% to 8.5%. IBUs should be in the range of 20-40.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Schwarzbier;"Schwarzbier is a German style of ""black beer"" that uses lager yeast. The aroma and taste usually include subtle hints chocolate or coffee. The feel should be somewhat thin. ABV should be in the lower range around 3% to 6%";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Scottish Export;"All of the Scottish ales share the same description and are differentiated mainly based on gravity and alcoholic strength. The Scottish ales follow in the English tradition of having a confusing naming convention. The names are steeped in tradition and history, one thing the Scottish are famous for. To start with are the Schilling designations. These are remnants of the 1870 rating system in which the price of beer, including the taxes, was rated in the old pre-decimal shillings. 60 Shillings was a light ale; 70 Shillings was a heavy ale; 80 Shillings was an export; and 90+ Shillings was a barley-wine known as 'Wee Heavy'";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Strong Bitter;"Essentially more aggressive and more balanced Bitters, both in alcohol and hop character, but nothing overpowering. Color range will be similar, though leaning towards the darker end of the scale; dark golds to copper. Low carbonation. Malts tend to be more pronounced, often toasty and fruity, with maybe some notes diacetyl. And despite ""bitter"" being in its name, ESBs are not really all that bitter. They key to an ESB is balance.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Sweet Stout;Milk / Sweet Stouts are basically stouts that have a larger amount of residual dextrins and unfermented sugars that give the brew more body and a sweetness that counters the roasted character. Milk Stouts are very similar to Sweet Stouts, but brewers add unfermentable sugars, usually lactose, to the brew kettle to add body and some sweetness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Trappist Single;Trappist Single is a brand new style included in the 2015 BJCP style guidelines. The highly attenuated and well carbonated Trappist ale is typically pale in color with spicy and floral hop character, subtle but supportive grain sweetness, and of course the fruity-spicy character of Trappist yeast. Think German Pils with a big dose of Belgian yeast character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Tropical Stout;As a stout, tropical stout should be quite dark in color, in the very deep brown to black range, with a medium-full to full body. Since the alcohol is above average in strength (5.5% to 8%, sometimes slightly more), the beer can have a warming feel to it. The lower bitterness (30 to 50 IBUs, as compared to the 50 to 70 IBUs in the foreign extra stout) helps the beer seem sweeter. Given that the bittering level can still vary quite a bit, the sweetness level of the beer can also be quite variable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Vienna Lager;Vienna Lager is a lager style that was originated in Vienna, Austria. The color should be medium red-brown to copper. There should be an obvious malt sweetness in both aroma and taste. Hop presence should be low. Mouthfeel should be clean and crisp. ABV should also be somewhat low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Wee Heavy;"All of the Scottish ales share the same description and are differentiated mainly based on gravity and alcoholic strength.

Weissbier;Weisse is a top-fermented, bottle conditioned wheat beer made with both traditional warm-fermenting yeasts and lactobacillus culture. They have a rapidly vanishing head and a clear, pale golden straw-coloured appearance. The taste is refreshing, tart, sour and acidic, with a lemony-citric fruit sharpness and almost no hop bitterness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Weizenbock;Weizenbock is a strong German wheat beer. It is similar to a Hefeweizen, although darker and higher in malt flavor and alcohol. To be considered in this style, German law requires at least 50% wheat malt to be used in the brewing process. This style uses ale yeast, and gets a slightly spicy tone from the yeast. Color should be medium red-brown or darker, with a cloudy appearance. Aroma and taste should be highlighted by both wheat sweetness and malt characteristics such as caramel. ABV is likewise higher than pale German wheat style, usually 6% or higher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Wheatwine;A Wheat Wine (also called an American Style Wheat Wine) is a stronger wheat beer that is brewed with 50% or more wheat malt. The color ranges from gold to dark amber. The style is full bodied and has a high malt sweetness. Hop presence should be medium to low in both aroma and flavor. Fruit tones should be noted in both aroma and taste. Other style notes include bready, wheat, honey or caramel notes. ABV should be in the range of 8% to 12%. IBUs are medium at 40-80, usually at the lower end of the range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
White IPA;Braven’s flagship beer, like its Co-Founders, lives just a step off the beaten path. A delicious blend of two distinct styles, Braven White delivers the hoppy bite of an American IPA that’s balanced by the soft wheat character and hints of spice of a Belgian White. Our unique White IPA offers maximum character and flavor in every easy-to-drink pint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Witbier;"Witbier (literally, ""white beer"" in Belgium) is one Belgian version of a wheat beer. It is also sometimes called a ""Witte"". The color should be straw yellow to gold, with a notable cloudy haze. A true historical rendering of the style will not use hops, but instead a mixture of spices, herbs and orange. However, current versions of the style generally include hops as a portion of the mixture (or ""gruit""). Despite that fact, the hop presence in both aroma and flavor should be minimal. However, there should be a notable citrus or slight acidity present. ABV should be somewhat low.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
